### Solving the "Wordle" problem
This mini-project is directly resulting from a video by Matt Parker ([Stand-up Maths](https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths) on YouTube), which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks).

You can find his original code for it [here](https://github.com/standupmaths/fiveletterworda).

The gist of the problem is to find all combinations of five 5-letter words that contain one of every letter in the alphabet (except for 1) without any overlap between the words.

The wordlist used is the same as used by Matt Parker in his example. The list can be found [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).
